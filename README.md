#### We used Trello to manage our workflow and stay on schedule

#### Group Programming

- We regularly leveraged pair and group programming to keep all team members active in every stage of the development process and approach every problem as a cohesive unit, from multiple perspectives.

- This may have slowed our overal rate of prograss, but it gave every developer exposure to every stage of development and kept our momentum steady.

#### Obstacles

- Use of Materialized Paths to navigate through files and folders

- Creating the breadcrumb effect to show that navigation to the user on the front end

- Heroku deployment
